### Dart Basic Exercises 🐦
This repository contains solutions to a set of beginner-level Dart programming exercises, focused on I/O, arithmetic operations, and basic logic implementation.

📄 File: division_rounding.dart

### Swap Two Numbers

Demonstrates how to swap two numbers using a temporary variable.

📄 File: swap.dart

⚠️ Note: Due to how Dart handles function parameters (passed by value), this function prints the swapped values inside but does not affect the original variables in main().

Greatest Common Divisor (GCD)

Calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers using iteration.

📄 File: gcd.dart

🛠️ Technologies Used
Dart Programming Language

dart:io for input

dart:math for mathematical operations
